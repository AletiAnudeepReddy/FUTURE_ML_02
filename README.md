# 📊 Churn Prediction System using Random Forest Classifier

This project is part of my learning journey in Machine Learning.  
The goal of this task is to **predict customer churn** (whether a customer will leave or stay) using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical business challenges, especially in the telecom, banking, and subscription-based services.  
By predicting churn, companies can take proactive steps to retain customers.

In this project:
- Performed **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
- Built and trained a **Random Forest Classification Model**.
- Evaluated the model with **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix**.
- Interpreted results using **SHAP values** to understand feature importance.

## 📂 Key Features
- Random Forest Classifier for churn prediction  
- Model evaluation using classification metrics  
- Confusion matrix visualization  
- SHAP summary plot for explainable AI  

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved accuracy of around **79%** on the test set  
- Found that key features (e.g., tenure, contract type, payment method) strongly influence churn predictions  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Google Colab)  
- **Scikit-learn** (model building)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (data preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (visualizations)  
- **SHAP** (model interpretability)  

---

## 📌 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**  
2. Upload your dataset (`.csv`)  
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## 📷 Sample Outputs
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- SHAP Feature Importance Plot

## 🌟 Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:  
- How to preprocess data for classification problems  
- How Random Forest works for churn prediction  
- How to interpret ML models using SHAP values
